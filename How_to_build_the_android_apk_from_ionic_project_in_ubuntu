Firstly, if we need to build the Android apk from ionic project in ubuntu need to follow further steps :

     -> sudo command : is used to give you the access of the root in Ubuntu. Some of the commands willnot work without 
                       sudo, so if any command is not working without sudo then use sudo infront of it or viceversa.
                        

1.   >  >  >   To install Node in Ubuntu in Command Line(Terminal)    <

      1.1   > sudo apt-get install nodejs
          After 1.1 is done then check or make sure you must installed the latest vesion of node according to you.
          
      1.2   > nodejs -v 
          If it shows the version ofn ode then it is installed ! .where -v stands for version.
          
      
      The nodejs package contains the nodejs binary as well as npm, so you donâ€™t need to install npm separately.
     
      npm uses a configuration file in your home directory to keep track of updates. It will be created the first
      time you run npm. Execute this command to verify that npm is installed and to create the configuration file:
      
            > npm -v
            Output something be like
            5.6.0
            
     * if in Case, you don't get npm then you can also install it manually :
     
     1.3    >
     
     
2.   >  >  >  To insatll
