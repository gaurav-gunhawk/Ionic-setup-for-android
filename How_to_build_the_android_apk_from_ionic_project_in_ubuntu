Firstly, if we need to build the Android apk from ionic project in ubuntu need to follow further steps :

     -> sudo command : is used to give you the access of the root in Ubuntu. Some of the commands willnot work without 
                       sudo, so if any command is not working without sudo then use sudo infront of it or viceversa.
                        

1.   >  >  >   To install Node , npm in Ubuntu in Command Line(Terminal)    <  <  <

      1.1   > sudo apt-get install curl
      
      1.2   > curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_13.x | sudo -E bash -
      
            After 1.2 is done then check or make sure you must installed the latest vesion of node according to you.
               But this command will install version 13 of node.
     
      1.3   > sudo apt-get install nodejs
      
          This command is used to install npm.
          
      1.4   > node -v
          
            This command is used check the version of node in ystem either it is installed or not if it doesnot 
            shows the version means you must try all above steps agian.
            Output > v13.3.0 
            
      1.5   > npm -v

            I suggest you to download full Android Studio rather than downloading only SDK Manager beacuse it will 
            create alot of mess in downloading only SDK Manager.
            
            Then ,
            Go to , Tools -> SDK Manager
            Then download the SDK versions according to you.
