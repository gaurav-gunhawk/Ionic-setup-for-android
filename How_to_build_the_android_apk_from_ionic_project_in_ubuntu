Firstly, if we need to build the Android apk from ionic project in ubuntu need to follow further steps :

     -> sudo command : is used to give you the access of the root in Ubuntu. Some of the commands willnot work without 
                       sudo, so if any command is not working without sudo then use sudo infront of it or viceversa.
